# CS20-S16-lab03

This assignment involves learning a bit about git and github, as well as learning about turtle graphics.

The git/github part is divided into these sections:

* [Git-Basics.md](Git-Basics.md)
* [Git-CSIL-Setup.md](Git-CSIL-Setup.md)	
* [Git-Commands-and-Workflow.md](Git-Commands-and-Workflow.md)

The turtle graphics part appears here:

* [lab03-Turtle-Graphics-Assignment.md](lab03-Turtle-Graphics-Assignment.md)

* The submit.cs link is here: https://submit.cs.ucsb.edu/form/project/472/submission
 * In this case, the submit.cs link only checks your syntax. We'll have to run the code manually to see if it works correctly.

In addition, the following information may be helpful in the future.

* [Git-for-homework.md](Git-for-homework.md)
