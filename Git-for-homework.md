One of the most basic ways to get started with using git and github is to simply create and edit files and directories 
directly at the github.com web page.

We'll invite you to use github.com to create, edit and submit your solutions to homework assignments in this course.  (What homework assignments?
Those are coming soon, and will be based on the textbook by Guttag.)

During lecture on April 19, 2016, we will (or did, depending on when you are reading this) create a 
special private github repo for each student in the course, with their name, e.g.

* cs20-s16-Alice-private
* cs20-s16-Bob-private
* cs20-s16-Chris-private
* cs20-s16-Dani-private
etc.

You can find your repo by logging into github.com, visiting https://github.com/UCSB-CMPTGCS20-S16, 
and then looking for a repo with your name in it.  If you don't see one, post on Piazza (publicly or privately, as you wish) with your real name, and your github.com id.

(It likely goes without saying, but out of an abundance of caution: you SHOULD NOT, and DO NOT NEED to share your password. With anyone. Ever.  Just your userid.)


In this repository, we'll invite you to create files with various names for each of the homework assignments in the class.
