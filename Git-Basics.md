# Git Basics

Git is a piece of open source software for version control.

Git makes it easier for programmers to keep track of changes in their code

Git makes it easier for programmers to collaborate on projects and share their code with one another

The basic unit of work in git is a repository (or repo, for short.)  
A repository is simply a directory (folder) that contains files, and 
possibly other folders containing files and folders along with the entire 
history of all changes to those files and folders over time.

There are many places a git repo can be stored:
* on your own personal Windows, Mac, or Linux computer
* under a directory on your CSIL account
* on a cloud-based storage provider.  

The website github.com is a for-profit business that provides cloud-based 
storage of git repositories, along with a nice web interface to work with git repos.   
Github.com provides free resources for "open source" projects—ones where the contents of the 
repository are public—but typically charges money for "closed source" projects, when the contents of the repo are private.    
That's how they make their money.

Github provides universities with an "academic discount" (actually, "free") to enable us to provide 
you with private github repositories at no cost to either you, or the University of California.    

These private repos can be seen by your instructors and mentors,  
but no one else has access to the contents.   
We can also set up pair repos where you and your pair partner have access, but no one else does.

A github organization is a collection of users, teams, and repositories.    
Github provides academic discounts through these organizations.   
Anyone can set up an organization on the "free plan", and 
then instructors at educational institutions can request the academic discount for their "organization".
